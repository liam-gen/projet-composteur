When connecting the Arduino with a USB cable, you should see it appear as /dev/ttyACM0, or /dev/ttyUSB0 (sometimes the number can be different, for example /dev/ttyACM1).

Simply run ls /dev/tty*
and you should see it. At this point if youâ€™re not sure which device is the Arduino board, simply disconnect the board (remove the USB cable), and run ls /dev/tty*
again. This way you will easily spot the serial device name of your Arduino.
